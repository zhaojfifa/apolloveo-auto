# Matrix Script Task Entry Contract v1

Date: 2026-04-27
Status: Phase A landing (Matrix Script First Production Line Wave — `docs/architecture/ApolloVeo_2.0_Matrix_Script_First_Production_Line_Wave_指挥单_v1.md` §6 Phase A)
Authority:
- `docs/architecture/ApolloVeo_2.0_Matrix_Script_First_Production_Line_Wave_指挥单_v1.md` §3, §4, §6 Phase A, §7
- `docs/contracts/matrix_script/packet_v1.md`
- `schemas/packets/matrix_script/packet.schema.json`
- `docs/contracts/factory_input_contract_v1.md`
- `docs/contracts/factory_language_plan_contract_v1.md`
- `docs/product/asset_supply_matrix_v1.md` (matrix_script row)
- `docs/design/surface_task_area_lowfi_v1.md`

## Purpose

Declare the **operator-facing entry surface** by which a Matrix Script task is initiated, and the **mapping rule** by which that entry projects onto the frozen Matrix Script packet truth (`schemas/packets/matrix_script/packet.schema.json` + `docs/contracts/matrix_script/packet_v1.md`).

This contract is the Phase A deliverable of the Matrix Script First Production Line Wave. It does not author packet truth; it declares which operator inputs are accepted at task creation, and which packet fields each input is allowed to seed.

## Ownership

- Owner: product (entry-surface author) + design (surface mapping)
- Runtime consumers: future task-creation path (Phase B+), packet validator (rejects vendor pins / state fields regardless of entry origin)
- Non-owners: routers, workbench presenters, delivery surfaces, donor (SwiftCraft) modules, provider adapters, frontend platform

## Scope discipline (normative)

This contract:
1. defines the **closed set** of fields the Matrix Script task entry MAY accept;
2. classifies each field as **line truth** (projects onto a packet field) or **operator hint** (seeds a packet authoring step but is itself non-truth);
3. classifies each field as **required**, **optional**, or **deferred**;
4. names what entry-time inputs are explicitly **forbidden** (provider/model selection, status-shape fields, donor-side concepts);
5. names what is **deferred** to Phase B (Workbench Variation Surface), Phase C (Delivery Binding), Phase D (Publish Feedback Closure).

This contract does NOT:
- define runtime task creation behavior;
- redeclare packet truth;
- introduce a second source of state or task truth;
- name vendors / models / providers / engines (validator rule R3);
- attach truth-shape state fields (`status`, `ready`, `done`, `phase`, `current_attempt`, `delivery_ready`, `final_ready`, `publishable`) to any entry field (validator rule R5);
- re-version the Matrix Script packet, schema, or sample.

## Entry field set (closed)

The Matrix Script task entry accepts exactly the fields below. The set is closed at v1; additions require a re-version of this contract.

| entry field         | discipline | classification     | line truth? | seeds (packet path)                                                         | authority (generic contract)                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `topic`             | required   | operator hint      | no          | `metadata.notes` (free-form trail) + downstream Phase B authoring seed       | `factory_input_contract_v1` (operator metadata envelope)           |
| `source_script_ref` | required   | line truth (asset) | yes (opaque ref) | downstream `slot_pack.delta.slots[].body_ref` (resolved by Phase B authoring; entry only carries the opaque handle) | `factory_input_contract_v1` (`source_script` per `asset_supply_matrix_v1`) |
| `language_scope`    | required   | line truth         | yes         | `slot_pack.delta.slots[].language_scope` (`source_language`, `target_language[]`) | `factory_language_plan_contract_v1` (`g_lang`)                      |
| `target_platform`   | required   | operator hint      | no          | `metadata.notes` (free-form trail); does NOT bind delivery — delivery binding is Phase C | `factory_input_contract_v1` (operator metadata envelope)           |
| `variation_target_count` | required | operator hint  | no          | seeds Phase B authoring of `variation_matrix.delta.cells[]` cardinality; does NOT itself become a packet field | `factory_input_contract_v1` (operator metadata envelope)           |
| `audience_hint`     | optional   | operator hint      | no          | seeds Phase B selection within `variation_matrix.delta.axes[axis_id="audience"].values[]` (axis values are packet truth; the hint is not) | `factory_input_contract_v1` (operator metadata envelope)           |
| `tone_hint`         | optional   | operator hint      | no          | seeds Phase B selection within `variation_matrix.delta.axes[axis_id="tone"].values[]`     | `factory_input_contract_v1` (operator metadata envelope)           |
| `length_hint`       | optional   | operator hint      | no          | seeds Phase B `slot_pack.delta.slots[].length_hint` and/or `variation_matrix.delta.axes[axis_id="length"]` range pick | `factory_input_contract_v1` (operator metadata envelope)           |
| `product_ref`       | optional   | operator hint      | no          | `metadata.notes` (free-form trail)                                            | `factory_input_contract_v1` (operator metadata envelope)           |
| `operator_notes`    | optional   | operator hint      | no          | `metadata.notes`                                                              | `factory_input_contract_v1` (operator metadata envelope)            |

Required vs optional discipline matches the `matrix_script` column of `docs/product/asset_supply_matrix_v1.md` for the `source_script` and `language_scope_decl` rows. Other entry fields are operator hints and are required only as authoring scaffolding for Phase B; they never become packet line truth.

## Line-truth vs operator-hint rule

- **Line truth** entries are the only entries that appear (after Phase B authoring) inside the packet's `line_specific_refs[].delta` blocks or generic-ref shapes. Line-truth content is owned by the packet, never by the entry surface.
- **Operator hint** entries seed Phase B authoring decisions but are themselves stored only as free-form trail in `metadata.notes` (or carried in an out-of-packet authoring scratch — to be defined in Phase B). They MUST NOT mutate any closed kind-set (`axis_kind_set`, `slot_kind_set`).
- An entry surface that promotes an operator hint into a packet truth field without going through Phase B authoring is a **violation** of this contract.

## Required vs optional (entry-time)

- Required: `topic`, `source_script_ref`, `language_scope`, `target_platform`, `variation_target_count`.
  - `source_script_ref` and `language_scope` are required by the asset supply matrix for the `matrix_script` line; absence MUST block task creation.
  - `topic`, `target_platform`, `variation_target_count` are required by this entry contract as the minimum operator-hint scaffolding so Phase B authoring has enough seed to construct a non-trivial variation matrix; absence MUST block task creation at the entry surface, but their absence is NOT a packet-truth gate (the packet validator does not see them).
- Optional: `audience_hint`, `tone_hint`, `length_hint`, `product_ref`, `operator_notes`.

## Deferred to later phases (entry surface MUST NOT collect)

The following are explicitly out of scope for Phase A entry. Any attempt to collect them at task entry is a violation of this contract.

| concern                          | deferred to                                                       |

| status / ready / done / delivery_ready / final_ready / publishable | **never** at entry surface (validator R5) |
| donor (SwiftCraft) module identity                            | **never** at entry surface                |
| Digital Anchor, W2.2, W2.3 concerns                           | out of this wave entirely                  |

## Forbidden at entry surface

- Any field named or shaped as `vendor_id`, `model_id`, `provider`, `provider_id`, `engine_id` (validator R3).
- Any field named or shaped as `status`, `state`, `phase`, `ready`, `done`, `current_attempt`, `delivery_ready`, `final_ready`, `publishable` (validator R5; restated by packet schema `metadata.not.anyOf`).
- Any donor-side concept: `donor_*`, `swiftcraft_*`, absorption-module names.
- Any second source of task / state truth (envelope §Forbidden).
- Any cross-line concern (Hot Follow, Digital Anchor, Avatar, VideoGen).
- Any frontend exposure of `vendor_id` / `model_id` / `donor_*` per `docs/product/asset_supply_matrix_v1.md` §Decoupling rules item 7.

## Mapping note (entry → packet)

entry.operator_notes           →  metadata.notes (appended; non-truth trail)
```

Mapping discipline:

- Only `entry.source_script_ref` and `entry.language_scope` cross from entry surface to packet **truth** (line-specific delta). All other entries cross only to `metadata.notes` (non-truth trail) or to Phase B authoring scaffolding (out of packet entirely).
- Closed kind-sets (`axis_kind_set`, `slot_kind_set`) are NOT widened by any entry field. Hints select among existing values; they never add values.
- `binding.capability_plan[]`, `binding.worker_profile_ref`, `binding.deliverable_profile_ref`, `binding.asset_sink_profile_ref` are **NOT** populated from the entry surface. They are static for the Matrix Script line per `docs/contracts/matrix_script/packet_v1.md` §Capability plan and §Binding profiles.
- `evidence.ready_state` is **NOT** writable from the entry surface. `ready_state` is one-way projection from validator output (`docs/design/surface_task_area_lowfi_v1.md` §Gate Truth Rule).

## Source script ref shape (addendum, 2026-05-02; tightened by §8.F on 2026-05-03)

Authority: `docs/reviews/matrix_script_trial_blocker_and_realign_review_v1.md` §8.A; `docs/reviews/matrix_script_followup_blocker_review_v1.md` §6 (§8.F — Opaque Ref Discipline vs Operator Usability) Option F1.

`source_script_ref` is an opaque reference handle. The entry surface MUST reject any value that carries script body text, document prose, any publisher article URL, or any other non-reference payload. The server-side guard at `gateway/app/services/matrix_script/create_entry.py` enforces the closed shape declared here; the operator-facing input at `gateway/app/templates/matrix_script_new.html` mirrors the same shape via `pattern` / `maxlength`.

A submitted value is accepted only when it matches one of the two closed shapes below.

1. **URI with closed opaque-by-construction scheme.** Scheme prefix from the closed set followed by `://` and at least one non-whitespace character.
   - Closed scheme set: `content`, `task`, `asset`, `ref`. (No external web schemes.)
   - Example: `content://matrix-script/source/001`.
2. **Bare token id.** `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._\-:/]{3,}$`. No whitespace, no embedded scheme separator (`://`). Used for short opaque content storage handles or external system ids.
   - Example: `MS-SRC-2026-04-001`.

Independent of the shape match, the value MUST also satisfy:

- single line (no `\n` or `\r`);
- no whitespace anywhere;
- length ≤ 512 characters.

On any rejection the entry surface raises the existing entry-validation error type (HTTP 400) with a localised message that names the field and the constraint. The rejection MUST happen before `build_matrix_script_task_payload` runs, so the payload-builder never sees body text.

The closed scheme set is exhaustive at v1; widening it requires a re-version of this contract. Narrowing it is permitted only if no live trial sample relies on the removed scheme.

### Opaque-by-construction discipline (§8.F tightening, 2026-05-03)

Authority: `docs/reviews/matrix_script_followup_blocker_review_v1.md` §6 Option F1; `docs/execution/MATRIX_SCRIPT_F_OPAQUE_REF_DISCIPLINE_EXECUTION_LOG_v1.md`.

Original §8.A accepted scheme set was `{content, task, asset, ref, s3, gs, https, http}`. §8.F tightens it to `{content, task, asset, ref}` — the four schemes the product owns the dereferencing path for. The dropped schemes were:

- **`https` / `http`**: external web content. The product cannot dereference an arbitrary publisher URL to authored script content (web scraping is out of scope for this wave). The follow-up review §3 documented the live operator submitting `https://news.qq.com/rain/a/...` as a trigger case.
- **`s3` / `gs`**: object-storage buckets. While "opaque by convention" (the product would own its own bucket), the entry surface has no enforceable mechanism to distinguish a product-owned bucket from a public / arbitrary one, and the §8.C `body_ref` template never emits `s3://` / `gs://`. Removing them aligns the closed set with the only schemes the product actually mints under Plan A.

The four retained schemes are **opaque-by-construction inside the product**: the product (or a trial-wave operator-token convention, see below) is the sole authority that mints / interprets each scheme.

### Operator transitional convention (Plan A trial wave only)

Until Plan E lands an operator-facing minting / lookup service (Plan C C1, contract-frozen, gated), operators have no in-product way to obtain a `content://` / `task://` / `asset://` / `ref://` handle. For the Plan A trial wave the only supported operator-facing form is:

```
content://matrix-script/source/<token>
```

where `<token>` is operator-chosen, opaque to the product, and uniquely identifies the operator's script source within the operator's own bookkeeping. The product treats the entire ref as an opaque label: it never dereferences `<token>` to body content, never validates uniqueness across operators, and never reads back content by this handle. Operators are responsible for keeping their own mapping of `<token>` to wherever the source lives (private doc, internal page, working notes, etc.).

This convention is **transitional**:

- the convention is operator-discipline only — it is not a product feature;
- it does not back-fit a content-mint endpoint, asset-library service, or any new operator-facing service into this wave (Plan C C1 / Plan E);
- it produces refs that pass the §8.A guard's `content` scheme path and the §8.F tightened scheme set with no further changes;
- the refs are interchangeable with §8.C's deterministically-authored `body_ref` template (`content://matrix-script/{task_id}/slot/{slot_id}`) at the contract level; both forms are opaque-by-construction `content://...` URIs;
- removal path: when Plan E adds the in-product minting flow (Option F2 path), the convention is replaced by the minted handle. Operators are not asked to migrate existing handles; the convention is forward-compatible with whatever Plan E mints because the product never bound any meaning to `<token>` beyond opaqueness.

### Why this is contract-tightening AND a usability adjustment

The original §8.A addendum included `https` / `http` as a pragmatic allowance for operators who already had URLs on hand. The follow-up review §6 observed that this allowance defeats the contract intent ("opaque ref handle") because a publisher article URL is not opaque-by-construction in the product, and there is no documented dereference path for URL-shaped refs anywhere downstream. §8.F removes that pragmatic allowance and pins the operator transitional convention so the operator workflow remains usable in the Plan A trial without the contract intent slippage. Plan E (Option F2) is the proper resolution: a real operator-facing minting flow that owns the `content://` namespace.

### Out of scope for §8.F

- no in-product minting / lookup service (Plan C C1, gated to Plan E);
- no `POST /assets/mint?kind=script_source` endpoint (Plan E Option F2);
- no asset-library service expansion;
- no operator brief refresh (the §8.D operator brief still reflects the pre-§8.F scheme set; the §8.H operator brief re-correction follow-up is the natural successor that re-aligns §3.2 / §6.2 / §7.1 with the §8.F tightened scheme set);
- no `body_ref` template change (`content://matrix-script/{task_id}/slot/{slot_id}` from §8.C is unchanged and remains opaque-by-construction);
- no `g_lang` token alphabet pinning (separate review);
- no widening of the closed scheme set; future widening requires a contract re-version, not an addendum;
- no Plan E gated items (B4 `result_packet_binding` URL-shaped-ref handling, D1 / D2 / D3 / D4) implementation;
- no second production line onboarding.

## Phase B deterministic authoring (addendum, 2026-05-03)

Authority: `docs/reviews/matrix_script_trial_blocker_and_realign_review_v1.md` §8.C (Option C1 — minimal real Phase B authoring).

The Plan A trial wave requires the Phase B workbench variation panel to render real resolvable axes / cells / slots for any fresh contract-clean Matrix Script sample. To meet that requirement without re-versioning `variation_matrix_contract_v1`, `slot_pack_contract_v1`, or `packet_v1` — and without introducing any provider / model / vendor / engine control — Phase B authoring runs **synchronously inside `build_matrix_script_task_payload`** at task-creation time. The authoring step is implemented at `gateway/app/services/matrix_script/phase_b_authoring.py::derive_phase_b_deltas(entry, task_id)`.

### Pinned axes

The authoring step always emits the three canonical axes named by the Mapping note above. Values are pinned for v1 trial reproducibility:

| `axis_id`  | `kind`        | `values`                                | `is_required` |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `tone`     | `categorical` | `["formal", "casual", "playful"]`       | `true`        |
| `audience` | `enum`        | `["b2b", "b2c", "internal"]`            | `true`        |
| `length`   | `range`       | `{"min": 30, "max": 120, "step": 15}`   | `false`       |

`axis_kind_set = ["categorical", "range", "enum"]` exactly. `slot_kind_set = ["primary", "alternate", "fallback"]` exactly. Both kind sets remain the closed sets pinned by `variation_matrix_contract_v1` §"Closed sets" and `slot_pack_contract_v1` §"Closed sets" — Phase B authoring does not widen them.

### Cell ↔ slot pairing

For `i ∈ [0, entry.variation_target_count)`:

- `cell_id = "cell_{i+1:03d}"`, `slot_id = "slot_{i+1:03d}"`.
- `cells[i].script_slot_ref == slots[i].slot_id` (round-trip lower bound).
- `slots[i].binds_cell_id == cells[i].cell_id` (round-trip upper bound).
- `cells[i].axis_selections = {"tone": TONES[i % 3], "audience": AUDIENCES[(i // 3) % 3], "length": LENGTH_PICKS[i % 7]}` where `LENGTH_PICKS = [30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120]` is the closed step-aligned walk over `length` axis values. The 9 × 7 = 63 distinct tuples cover the validated `variation_target_count` range `[1, 12]` with all `axis_selections` distinct.
- `slots[i].slot_kind = "primary"` (closed-set member; default per `slot_pack_contract_v1` §"Delta fields").

### Body ref shape

`slots[i].body_ref = "content://matrix-script/{task_id}/slot/{slot_id}"` is **opaque** and derived from `task_id` and `slot_id` only. It MUST NOT embed body text, MUST NOT carry the operator-supplied `source_script_ref`, and MUST use the `content` scheme from the §"Source script ref shape (addendum, 2026-05-02)" closed scheme set. The body-text-embedding ban from `slot_pack_contract_v1` §"Forbidden" is upheld by construction.

### Determinism

`derive_phase_b_deltas(entry, task_id)` is a pure function: no clock, no randomness, no env reads, no IO. Same `(entry, task_id)` produces the same deltas. The function does not mutate `entry` (which is a frozen dataclass) and does not write into the task repository.

### Hint consumption (out of scope this addendum)

Optional entry hints (`audience_hint`, `tone_hint`, `length_hint`) are mapped to Phase B authoring scaffolds by the §"Mapping note" above, but the Plan A trial wave's deterministic seed **does not yet consume them**. Plan E real-authoring may bias the rotation by hints without re-versioning this contract.

### Removal path

This deterministic seed is the Plan A trial wave's narrow Phase B authoring capability. Plan E may replace or extend `derive_phase_b_deltas` with a richer planner; such a replacement does not require re-versioning this contract so long as the pinned axes / kind sets / pairing rule / opaque-`body_ref` invariant remain honoured.

### Out of scope

- `g_lang` token alphabet — this addendum uses whatever ISO-639 short codes the §"Entry field set" already accepts (currently `mm`, `vi`); pinning the alphabet is a separate review against `factory_language_plan_contract_v1`.
- The Phase B render surface (`workbench_variation_surface_contract_v1`) — unchanged.
- Phase C delivery binding and Phase D publish-feedback closure — unchanged.
- Provider / model / vendor / engine selection — forbidden at all phases (validator R3).

## Acceptance (Phase A)

Phase A is green only when:

1. The entry field set above is the exact closed set used by any Matrix Script task-creation surface.
2. Every required entry field is collected; absence blocks task creation at entry.
3. No forbidden field is collected, displayed, or stored at entry.
4. Every line-truth entry maps onto a packet path that is reachable from the existing Matrix Script schema/contract; no new packet field is invented.
5. Every operator-hint entry maps either to `metadata.notes` or to Phase B authoring scaffolding; none is promoted to packet truth at entry time.
6. Implementation, if any, is Matrix-Script-only; no code path under `digital_anchor`, no provider/adapter touch, no Hot Follow business-logic change.

## What Phase A intentionally does NOT add

- No workbench variation authoring surface (Phase B).
- No delivery center binding (Phase C).
- No publish feedback projection (Phase D).
- No provider/model selection control (forbidden at all phases).
- No new packet schema / sample / contract version.
- No Digital Anchor entry (out of this wave).
- No Hot Follow change.
- No frontend platform rebuild.
- No runtime task-creation implementation in this Phase A landing — this contract is the surface-first definition; engineering implementation is sequenced separately and bounded by this contract.

## Remaining blockers before Phase B

1. Phase B requires this Phase A entry contract to be reviewed and accepted as the authority for the operator-supplied seed feeding workbench authoring.
2. Phase B requires the workbench authoring surface to consume the `entry.*` seed without re-authoring it — i.e. the workbench MUST start from this entry's projection into `metadata.notes` and Phase B authoring scaffolding, not from a freshly invented form.
3. Phase B requires `axis_kind_set` and `slot_kind_set` to remain frozen as declared in `docs/contracts/matrix_script/packet_v1.md` §LS1 / §LS2; this Phase A contract relies on that freeze to keep `audience_hint` / `tone_hint` / `length_hint` mapping stable.
