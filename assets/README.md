# Assets Library

This folder is the **long-term asset base** for operators and workflows.

## Structure
- library/: generic reusable assets (broll/audio/fonts/overlays)
- avatar/: avatar-specific assets (characters/drivers/scenes)
- hot_follow/: hot-follow templates and sources

## Rules
- Do not store copyrighted raw media without license.
- Prefer storing metadata + links + hashes when possible.
- Keep naming stable and machine-friendly.
